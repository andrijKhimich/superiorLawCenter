                        <p>Once you have been accused of a crime, several different things may happen to you. First, if
                          you have not already been
                          arrested, the authorities may ask you to surrender to their custody so that you may be booked
                          into jail for the crime
                          you are accused of committing. Other times, no arrest may be made, and you will face the
                          charges after a complaint has
                          been filed against you by the District Attorney. Still, other times a warrant may issue for
                          your arrest and the
                          authorities will pick you up on the warrant. Whatever your circumstances may be, our
                          experienced Criminal Defense
                          attorney will work to see that the process goes as smoothly as possible and that you remain at

                          outcome of your case.

                        <p>Your first court appearance is called an arraignment. This appearance date is either listed
                          at the bottom of a citation
                          or on a piece of paper given to you when released from jail. The arraignment is your
                          opportunity to answer the charges
                          that have been leveled against you. This typically comes in the form of a guilty or not guilty
                          plea. Bail may also be
                          set or adjusted at the arraignment hearing. Because so much is as stake, it is not advisable
                          to appear at the
                          arraignment without representation. You may unknowingly give up your rights or compromise your
                          case.

                        <p>Most Criminal cases are resolved at the pretrial stage. Following the arraignment, our
                          attorney will be provided with
                          arrest reports and other information about your arrest. A pretrial or readiness hearing is
                          then set for a date several
                          days or weeks after the arraignment, depending on the type of case. The purpose of the
                          pretrial or readiness hearing is
                          to attempt to resolve the court case or reach a plea bargain agreement. There may be several
                          pretrial appearances while
                          the attorney is gathering records and information and negotiating with the prosecutor and/or
                          judge.

                          essentially a report that is submitted to the prosecutor and the judge arguing a certain
                          position. The motion oftentimes
                          is accompanied by an evidentiary hearing in the courtroom where the attorney can present
                          evidence or hear evidence
                          presented by the prosecutor.

                          hearing, a judge will
                          decide if there is enough evidence to hold you accountable for the charges at a jury trial.

                        <p> <strong>Most cases do not result in a jury trial.</strong> Instead, cases are typically

                          not satisfied with the results of pretrial negotiations, and there is a good cause to contest
                          your case, you and your
                          attorney may elect to take your case before a jury. The jury trial takes place in a courtroom
                          in front of the judge and
                          jurors. Evidence may be presented by both the prosecutor and defendant. If your case goes

                        <p>The length of a criminal case depends on whether it is a misdemeanor or felony and the
                          seriousness of the conduct
                          alleged. In some instances, a prosecutor may delay filing a complaint against you, thus
                          causing a delay in the court
                          process. Once a complaint is filed, the average case will take 60 -90 days to resolve if no
                          jury trial is involved. If a
                          jury trial is involved, your case will take longer because we want to make sure we’re prepared

                          misdemeanor or a felony. The seriousness of the case often depends on the extent of the

                          With the help of an
                          experienced Criminal defense attorney, criminal convictions can potentially be prevented
                          altogether. There are many
                          factors that play into a Criminal arrest. The circumstances of the arrest are sometimes
                          unclear and, even if the facts
                          appear to point towards guilt, the rights of the accused may have been violated. Officers are
                          often prone to error, the
                          traffic stop may not have been legal, a search of your house may not have been legal, and
                          scientific evidence may have
                          produced a distorted result, and a host of other issues could apply. Regardless of your
                          feelings or circumstances, an
                          attorney is an invaluable resource.

                        <p>In most San Diego misdemeanor cases, Superior Law Center can represent you in court without
                          your attendance. In fact,
                          you may not have to set foot in court at all. There are some notable exceptions to this rule.
                          For example, you must
                          appear in court for a domestic violence case even if it is a misdemeanor. If your case is a
                          felony, you must appear at
                          every court hearing.

                          This is because your
                          credibility is not assessed during pretrial motions. If a jury trial is carried out in your
                          case, your presence will be
                          important.

                          to bring your case before
                          a jury. If you and your attorney are displeased with the outcome of pretrial negotiations, and
                          there is a good case to
                          be made on your behalf, a jury trial may be the most beneficial course of action.

                          More often, however, the charges are reduced to lesser offenses. By achieving a victory in
                          court or obtaining a
                          reduction in the charges against you, Superior Law Center is potentially able to prevent an
                          arrest and conviction from
                          ever appearing on your record. Even with a lesser charge on your record, jail or prison time
                          can be reduced or avoided
                          altogether, fines can be reduced, probation periods can be shortened, court ordered programs
                          lessened, registration
                          avoided, and your arrest will have much less of an impact on your life. Because so much is at
