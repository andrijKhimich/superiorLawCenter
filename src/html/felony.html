                <p><strong>The information collected from users is used for the following purposes:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you’re charged with a DUI, you only have ten days to get in contact with the DMV about your
                    license. Otherwise, it
                    will be suspended.</li>
                  <li>California law requires that drivers submit to either a breathalyzer or blood analysis.</li>
                  <li>Breathalyzer results can often be successfully contested in court. (Was the equipment properly
                    calibrated? Was it used
                    correctly?)</li>
                  <li>If you are convicted of a DUI, you face anywhere from 48 hours to
                    six months.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will never share, sell or rent the information you have provided us to anyone.</p>
                <h4 class="title-4">Opting Out</h4>
                <p>You may opt out from any future contacts from us at anytime by contacting us at <strong><a

                <h4 class="titl-4">Your Access to and Control Over Information</h4>
                <p>We will modify or delete any personal information we hold about you at your request. Users have a
                  right to get a copy
                  from us of the personal information we hold about them. If you wish to receive a copy of this

                <p>Transmission or receipt of any information from this website does not create an attorney-client
                  relationship, and you
                  should not act or rely upon any information appearing on this website without seeking the advice of an
                  attorney. The

                <p>Note also that sending an e-mail to our office does not create an attorney-client relationship, and
                  none will be formed
                  unless there is an expressed agreement between the firm and the client. Thus, we strongly advise

                  confidential or privileged information to us until you can establish such a relationship. Furthermore,
                  we advise against
                  sending privileged or confidential information through e-mail at all, since we can in no way ensure
                  the security of your
                  e-mail.

                        yourself;
                        if you are seeking someone who truly cares for his clients and what he does, then going with
                        Superior Law Center is a no
