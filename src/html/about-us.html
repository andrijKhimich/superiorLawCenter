                <h2 class="title-2"> <span>WHY SHOULD YOU HIRE A </span> CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY?</h2>
                <p><strong>When you’ve been accused of a crime in San Diego, it’s important to weigh all your options
                    carefully. Now is the time to
                    make the smartest decisions to best protect your rights and stay out of jail.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Most people we speak with know right away that they need help from a private defense attorney, but
                  some do consider the
                  option of not hiring an attorney to protect them. When you hire a private criminal defense attorney,
                  there are several
                  distinct factors to consider:
                </p>
                <p>Our attorneys take on a limited case volume, specifically so we can provide the best possible service
                  and results. Our
                  #1 goal is to get your charges reduced and dropped, keep you out of jail, and protect what’s important
                  to you.
                </p>
                <p>The results of you or your loved ones case is directly intertwined with the reputation of not only
                  the attorney, but the
                  entire law firm. This creates a significant amount of incentive for Mr. Friis to strive for the best
                  possible outcome,
                  which we feel shows in our case results and victories in San Diego.
                </p>
                <p>Superior Law Center has won over 2000 of cases in San Diego, and as a result, we have experience and
                  relationships with
                  the judges that can have a significant impact on the outcome of your case.
                </p>
                <p>At Superior Law Center, we make ourselves personally available to our clients all hours of the day.
                </p>
                <p>If you believe you are guilty and you have no options, a skilled San Diego defense attorney can often
                  get penalties &
                  fines significantly reduced. We also have a history of getting costly fines removed substituted for
                  community service,
                  which can be a big benefit. In some cases we are able to get the entire case thrown out.
                </p>
                <p>Defending you & your future can either be someone’s “job” or it can be their entire living, and
                  defending people like
                  you in San Diego is what we do every single day.
                </p>
                <p>There is no limit on the amount of time and resources you can put into protecting you or your loved
                  ones future. And
                  when you hire a attorney to represent you, you are showing the court that you take yourself and your
                  rights seriously
                  and you are demanding to be treated with respect. We don’t just seek to settle your case and risk a
                  possible detriment
                  to your career or your future. We will use every defense strategy possible to get you or your loved
                  one the best result,
                  even if it means going to trial.</p>
                <p>It’s your life, and your future…it’s really up to you how far you’re willing to go to protect that.
                  When prison, fines,
                  your record, and/or your career are on the line, now is the most crucial time to make the right
                  decision.

                          suspension of your commercial driver’s license for a period of one year to life. For many, the
                          revocation of a

                          The punishment for injuring somebody while driving under the influence is more severe than the

                          level of .05 percent or
                          higher. This differs from the .01 percent required for a person under the age of 21 to
                          potentially have their license
                          suspended through a DMV hearing, and is significantly lower than the .08 percent BAC level
                          established for those over
                          the age of 21. Individuals under 21 years of age are charged with being in violation of
                          Vehicle Code Section 23140,
                          which can carry a year-long driver’s license suspension if unsuccessful at the DMV hearing. If

                        <p>In San Diego and across California, a DUI arrest means you must, by law, submit to a blood,
                          breath or, less commonly,
                          urine test. This law does not apply to field sobriety testing prior to your arrest — which may
                          lawfully be refused — but
                          instead to testing at a police station, jail or hospital after your arrest. If you have
                          refused a chemical test, this
                          unfortunately can result in a “refusal enhancement,” which increases DUI penalties. Our San
                          Diego DWI defense attorney,
                          however, can many times fight a refusal enhancement on the grounds that you were either not
                          lawfully arrested for DUI,
                          you were not under the influence at the time of your arrest, or the arresting officer failed
                          to properly inform you of
                          the consequences of refusing a chemical test.

                      <p>“Choosing Superior Law Center was the wisest decision I ever made. Superior Law Center did an
                        incredible job representing
                        me in court…I felt assured from the beginning with Superior Law Center’s professional manner and
                        extensive knowledge as
                        an attorney. The best advice I could offer someone seeking a lawyer is don’t second guess
                        yourself;
                        if you are seeking someone who truly cares for his clients and what he does, then going with
                        Superior Law Center is a no
                        brainer. Look at what he did for me. Superior Law Center changed the outcome
                        of my life and I will be forever grateful for all he’s done."</p>
